## Thank You 
I want to thank my brother, Luke Bandy, Senior Web Developer for his mentiorship, providing guidance and tools on Web development

Also, FreeCodeCamp.org, and Indian Coders for their tutorial on building this project. 

**##MISC**
Contributed code insight to the main tutorial project on github as the openai documentation was updated after the initial posting of the tutorial on youtube

Learned to debug this project with Devtools and various resources 

Sought out solutions and asked for input from other developers on this project 

Added personal styling to the app: "Johnny 5" from Short Circuit Movie


**##Final Thoughts**

I followed the tutorial instructions of inline styling. Though in the future, I would use a separate CSS documentation for clarity and readabibilty
 
Friday, February 16, 2024: openai gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-3.5-turbo-16k model will be automatically updated to gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
